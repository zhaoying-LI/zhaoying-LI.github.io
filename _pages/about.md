Hi, I am Zhaoying Li, a fourth year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, working with [Prof Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/). I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering at the Shandong University in 2018.

My research interests include spatial accelerator and compiler optimization.
